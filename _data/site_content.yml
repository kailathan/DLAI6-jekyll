  The concept of deep learning (DL) has been known in the neural network community for well over a decade already. 
  With the onset of more affordable powerful computing facilities, especially the prevalence of graphical processing units (GPUs) and tensor processing units (TPUs), 
  DL has been applied successfully and effectively in many state-of-the-art applications including computer vision, speech recognition, object detection, drug discovery, and so on. 
  More recently, the techniques in DL/AI are leveraged for the current COVID-19 pandemic, including in the rapid vaccine development processes. 
  DL basically uses deep neural network architecture with multiple layers to represent data with increasing abstraction and may be applied to supervised, unsupervised, as well as reinforcement learning. 
  Perhaps DL can be viewed in a literature sense for providing deeper insights into learning systems in general, as it continues to be one of the fastest growing and evolving fields of AI research.
  Current researches include deployment for COVID-19; however, there are more and more emphasis on the explainable and ethical AI aspects as well now. 
  Our panel session will take a closer look at future deep learning machines inspired by the human brain. edit...
